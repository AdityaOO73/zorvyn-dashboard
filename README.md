# 💰 ZORVYN – Fintech Dashboard UI

A modern, scalable, and fully responsive **Fintech Dashboard UI** built using **React, Redux, Tailwind CSS, and Recharts**.

This project was developed as part of an assignment to demonstrate the ability to design and implement a **real-world financial analytics interface**, focusing on **data visualization, clean architecture, role-based UI behavior, and user experience**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**ZORVYN Dashboard UI** simulates a real fintech application that helps users monitor and analyze their financial activities through structured data and interactive visualizations.

The application provides:

* A centralized financial overview
* Transaction management system
* Category-based spending insights
* Role-based UI interaction
* Data-driven insights for better decision-making

The goal was not just to build UI, but to showcase a **complete approach to solving a real-world frontend problem**.

---

## 🎯 Assignment Objectives Covered

This project fulfills all core requirements of the assignment:

* Dashboard with summary and visualizations
* Transactions management with filtering/search
* Role-based UI (frontend simulation)
* Insights generation
* Proper state management
* Responsive and clean UI

---

## 🧠 Architecture & Development Approach

### 🔹 Component-Based Architecture

The application is structured into reusable and domain-specific components:

* **Dashboard Components** → Charts, cards, transaction history
* **Insights Components** → Advanced analytics and breakdowns
* **Layout Components** → Navbar, Sidebar, Layout
* **Common Components** → Shared utilities

This ensures:

* Scalability
* Maintainability
* Reusability

---

### 🔹 State Management (Redux)

Redux is used to manage:

* Transactions data
* Filters and search
* Selected user role
* UI states (modals, sidebar)

**Slices:**

* `transactionSlice` → Financial data
* `uiSlice` → UI behavior

---

### 🔹 Data Visualization Strategy

Implemented using **Recharts**:

* 📊 **Time-Based Visualization**

  * Income vs Expense trends (Bar/Line charts)

* 🥧 **Categorical Visualization**

  * Spending breakdown (Pie chart with total)

* 📈 **Insights Charts**

  * Monthly comparisons and analytics

Focus was on:

* Clarity
* Readability
* Minimal clutter

---

### 🔹 UI/UX & Responsiveness

A key constraint:

👉 **“Make it responsive without changing the UI design”**

Handled by:

* Tailwind responsive utilities
* Flexible layouts
* Horizontal scrolling for tables
* Careful breakpoint handling

---
